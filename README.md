# Cash App Pay Kit SDK Sample app for Android.

This repository contains a Sample App that showcases an integration with Cash App Pay SDK for Android.

All you need to setup and run is to download and open the project with the latest stable version of Android Studio. In other words, it works out-of-the-box.

For written documentation on how to integrate with the SDK please refer to the following : [Android: Getting Started](https://developers.cash.app/docs/api/technical-documentation/sdks/pay-kit/android-getting-started).
